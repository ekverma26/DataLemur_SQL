## Expected Output  

| user_id | days_between |  
|---------|-------------|  
| 151652  | 2           |  
| 661093  | 21          |

## Explanation  
- The **first post** and **last post** for each user in 2021 are determined.  
- The difference in days between these two dates is calculated.  
- Only users who posted **at least twice in 2021** are considered.  

### Breakdown of Example  
- **User `151652`** posted on **07/10/2021** (first post) and **07/12/2021** (last post) â†’ **2 days difference**  
- **User `661093`** posted on **07/08/2021** (first post) and **07/29/2021** (last post) â†’ **21 days difference**  

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example! ðŸš€


SQL QUERY:
SELECT user_id, 
max(post_date :: DATE) - min(post_date :: DATE) as days_between
FROM posts
where date_part('year', post_date :: DATE) = 2021
GROUP BY user_id
having count(post_id)>1;
