### Question:
Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job.  
You want to find candidates who are proficient in **Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL**.

Write a query to list the candidates who possess **all of the required skills** for the job.  
Sort the output by `candidate_id` in **ascending order**.

### Assumption:
- There are no duplicates in the `candidates` table.

### `candidates` Table Schema:
| Column Name   | Type    |
|--------------|--------|
| candidate_id | integer |
| skill        | varchar |

### Sample Input:
| candidate_id | skill       |
|-------------|------------|
| 123         | Python     |
| 123         | Tableau    |
| 123         | PostgreSQL |
| 234         | R          |
| 234         | PowerBI    |
| 234         | SQL Server |
| 345         | Python     |
| 345         | Tableau    |

### Example Output:
| candidate_id |
|-------------|
| 123         |

### Explanation:
- Candidate `123` is displayed because they have **Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL** skills.
- Candidate `345` **is not included** in the output because they are missing **PostgreSQL**.


SQL QUERY:
SELECT candidate_id FROM candidates
where skill in ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')
GROUP BY candidate_id
having count(skill)=3
order by candidate_id ASC;
